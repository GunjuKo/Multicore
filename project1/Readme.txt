This project is count how many prime between start value and end value using a number of thread.
option for execution file
--num_thread  : option for number of thread you create
--start_value : start number 
--end_value   : end_value
--verbose     : print prime number between start number and end number
you can see execution time decrease depends on the number of thread.
Thanks
